### Summary
My main goal is to become an AI developer. I want to create high-quality and functionally services that deserve people. I consider myself a hardworking, inquisitive and sociable person. I decided to dedicate my life to IT, as I consider this a useful and exciting activity. I also dream of a future in which most of the human work will be performed by robots with the AI that I created.

Now I am engaged in backend development, using the object-oriented programming language Java, Java EE, Spring Framework, Git, Hibernate / JPA as development tools. Some of my projects can be seen on GitHub.

At the beginning of his journey, I learned such languages ​​as Pascal, C, C ++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am also closely acquainted with networking, routing and switching, since I studied at the Belarusian State Academy of Communications, attended Cisco Routing and Switching courses, at the end of which I received a certificate (CCNA), and also visited Huawei's main office under the Seeds of the Future program. 

At present I am studying frontand development (jQuery, Angular), neural networks, deep learning, methods and principles of working with big data.
